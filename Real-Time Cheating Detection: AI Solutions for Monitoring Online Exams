One of Think Exam’s best monitoring features is an AI-powered behavioural analytics system. It keeps a running check on the behavior of the person, such as eye movements, hand gestures, and body language. For example, cheating could be observed with signs like constant side-eyeing away from the screen or missing from the webcam for prolonged periods. Important for real-time suspicious behavior identification-more so, immediate action can be taken by exam administrators where necessary.

On the one hand, it rather jealously monitors that the concentration of the candidate is within the examination. This helps prevent cheating in various forms such as looking at a mobile phone or at reference materials hidden somewhere.

By extensively analysing historical data, the AI can effectively flag unconventionality and determine that it may be caused by misconduct, thus ensuring a high degree of accuracy in the detection of dishonest behavior in online exams performance.

NLP Algorithms can flag out inappropriate or copied parts through comparing their similarity with the academic resources database or even identifying common cheating phrases. Using this technique makes it possible for any such incident to be flagged for a possible plagiarism or dishonest communication concerning sharing or providing a single answer during the actual conduct of the exam.
