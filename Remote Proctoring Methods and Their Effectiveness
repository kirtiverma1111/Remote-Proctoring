Remote proctoring is a method where students are monitored remotely during exams ensuring the integrity of papers and preventing cheating. Such services make it possible for the organisation to run a secure assessment test from anywhere. 

With the introduction of remote proctoring tools, no matter the distance from the institution, exam-takers, and access to cheating during the online assessment has been controlled. These proctoring tools make use of complex technologies, including that of an AI proctor, to create a non-bias environment for the conduct of the exams.

Different Types of Remote Proctoring:-
