Integrating Remote Proctoring with Learning Management Systems Best Practices
The pandemic pushed online learning further ahead and, thus, an increased importance towards blended assessments came up. Remote proctoring, combined with learning management systems (LMS), promoted best practice for educational institutions and organisations keen to maintain the integrity of online examinations.

It is important that the chosen remote proctoring software has clear documentation and support, so that instructors find it easy to set up an exam. A user-friendly interface can make things easier for both the examiner and the candidates since it makes it easy to find one’s way through the system with very little training.

Include instructions on how to set up their testing environment and what to expect during the proctoring process. Clear communication reduces anxiety and helps candidates feel more confident.
Track testing sessions efficiently: Using recorded and live tracking options will improve the security of your exam. You can pass the exam right away. And there’s real-time tracking of high-stakes exams. Therefore, if suspicious activity is detected, immediate action can be taken.
Training employees and examiners: Make sure your employees are ready to use online proctoring technology effectively. This includes training on remote proctoring tools. Learning how to perform basic troubleshooting and understanding what action to take if something goes wrong during the exam…
Gather opinions: When you use remote proctoring it is important to gather feedback from applicants and supervisors. This will help you identify any issues or areas of improvement needed to improve the overall experience. It is important to continue to improvise to keep your assessment objective and user-friendly.

Proctoring Based on CCTVs and Images: Every individual attempting the test is put on facial recognition technology that continuously scans the individual to ascertain their true identity.
