The Role of Multi Browser Monitoring in Preventing Unauthorized Access
The new challenge presented in stopping unauthorised access and managing the integrity of the exam is how remote assessment has increased in scale. As a result of this, there is a growing need to pave the way for ensuring better security when providing online assessments and online exams. One of the most innovative solutions towards safeguarding and proofing cheating within the test is real-time multi browser monitoring.

In this blog, we should get a taste of what multi-browser monitoring is, where its role has to play in the world of checking security and why multi-browser monitoring is important for modern online examination platforms. For example, Think Exam.

Understanding Multi-Browser Monitoring
It is an interest to note that multi browser monitoring is devised for security to make sure that every activity of the candidate that passes through internet browsers is tracked and controlled. The intention of that is to ascertain that a test-taker cannot switch browsers to trace answers, access unauthorised material, or collaborate.

The technology is guaranteed by the way of real-time monitoring, presence of activity tracking in advance, and the most awaited intelligent alerts to capture the activity level in the test-taking spree in a justified manner.

Impact of Unauthorised Access
Unauthorised access during online exams compromises the integrity of the assessment process and has such far-reaching effects:

Compromised Results – cheating in the accessing of cheating or external resources leads to the wrong evaluation of the worth of test results.
Loss of Trust – inconsistency with the methods of assessment places mostly organizations and institutions at a loss over the faith that people have in them.
Increase in Costs – Security breach tends to lead to an increase in cost for it may result into consideration such as re-scheduling of exam dates. A more secure environment development tends to increase the cost of the test for each student.
Multi-browser browsing can protect against threats, bringing another layer of defense that is proactive against the threats.

The Features of Multi-Browser Monitoring.
Browser Lockdown
The feature prevents candidates taking the exam from opening multiple windows or going back and forth between the applications. At the start of an exam, it goes ahead and locks the browser so that, from that point on, only the examination interface itself can be the only thing offered to any candidate. 

Real-Time Alerts
Should a candidate attempt to open another browser or tab, the system at once generates an alert, enabling the proctors to make a quick take-down.

AI-Powered Detection
High-Level AI Algorithms would be able to trace out such subtle behavior that a person does when attempting to cheat, for example, in an organised manner or when taking advantage of withdrawn activity.

Comprehensive Reporting
Similarly, the software should boast vast and penetrating reports provided for candidate behavior: what URL did the candidate visit; from which IP address; and for how many full hours on end; and most possibly learn which page they were mostly sitting off the rest ‘.

The Role of Multi-Browser Monitoring in Preventing Unauthorised Access
Disabling External Searches: The candidate makes use of other browsers to search for answers or reference materials which are not authorised. All such issues are locked in multi-browser monitoring. Everything they will give their mind to will be exam content.
Attempting to Accommodate Interactions: However, it should be kept in mind that at the very time that browsers jostle for their place, a friend can also send messages and chat with the aid of some collaboration applications. Prevention of these acts is done through the assistance of multi browser monitoring. 
Maintaining Exam Fairness: Multi-browser monitoring enables the enforcement of rules in an unbiased way for all test-takers.
Enhancing Proctoring Efficiency: Multi browser monitoring is automated, allowing lesser responsibilities for the teacher proctor while monitoring the examination and more responsibility on more sophisticated methods of proctoring.
