The Role of AI in Enhancing Remote Proctoring Security
The objectives of the educational system change with social needs, which, in turn, increases the need for examination processes that are effective and, most importantly, secure. Online education has increased the need for remote proctoring services simply to facilitate the quality of online assessments. In this article, we will focus on how AI Remote Proctoring is made more secure to allow for an equitable examination process to both the teachers and the learners.

An Overview of Remote Proctoring
Remote Proctoring means using a proctoring service to ensure that candidates stay ethical and expand during the event of an online test. A range of proctoring tools and proctoring solutions utilise a variety of approaches aimed at inhibiting candidates from academic misconduct during examinations. Here’s where AI steps in, bringing in ultra-modern security features that are not available in the legacy system.

The Benefits of AI in Remote Proctoring
Increased Accuracy in Candidate’s Identity Verification: For the duration of the exam, the candidates’ identities are confirmed sequentially using the proctoring software equipped with a facial recognition system. This feature avoids the practice of impersonation since the given exam will only be attended to by the ready to take exam candidates. In addition to the AI ID verification, there is also biometrics whereby everyone has different unique features which helps especially in ensuring no cheating takes place in regard to assessments carried out online.
Satellite Proctoring and Monitoring: The AI systems possess the ability to monitor the candidates at all times of the examination and mark out atypical behaviour which can be presumed to be the candidates attempt to cheat. The advancement of this feature enhances online proctoring services as the exam supervisor is able to act on any malicious dealings witnessed within the examination period.
Smart Monitoring With Recording of Examination: By using smart monitoring with      recording of examination, the whole exam session can be recorded for review by the proctor or administrator at a later time. This function serves to enhance the examination process by giving a detailed description about the examination setting and helps in detecting any misconduct which may happen during the examination.
Simple And Uninterrupted Experience For Online Exams: When security is put in place for the online examinations there is always that tendency for a candidate to experience discomfort. The candidate is not worried thanks to the non-invasive AI work monitoring system which focuses on their output.
Think Proctor: A Revolutionary Remote Exam Security Solution:
Think Exam, the creator of Think Proctor, is one of the various innovations regarding remote proctoring that addresses the growing needs of educational institutions, government and corporate gears. Think Proctor addresses all the proctoring requirements in regard to online assessment together with its promising delivery for the test administrators and the applicants.

Here’s what makes Think Proctor a revolution in security of remote exams: 

AI-powered Image Proctoring: With Think Proctor, there is more to facial recognition than meets the eye. In every exam, the identities of the applicants are verified accurately and in real-time throughout the duration of the exam. Any attempts of impersonation are being verified at that very moment allowing only the legitimate user to proceed with the exam.

AI-based ID Verification: This highlights the use of artificial intelligence to ensure that there is appropriate verification of candidates before the examination starts and during the examination, hence decreasing chances of impersonation or cheating.

Recorded Monitoring: This feature enables recording of all the activities that are performed during the examination. The recorded examination can be reviewed by proctors or administrators in order to examine if there has been any misconduct, thus making it applicable for examinations that do not allow real time supervision.

Think Proctor eliminates any concerns of academic dishonesty in institutions as they ease the transition from physically administered tests to online assessments. The intuitive design of the system and artificial intelligence features ensure that candidates have a conducive yet non intrusive environment that enables them to sit for an examination while strict measures are in place.
