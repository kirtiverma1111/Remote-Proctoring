User Manual Multi-Browser Monitoring with Think Proctor
Multi-Browser Exam Monitoring Overview:-
What is Multi-Browser Exam Monitoring?
Multi-browser exam monitoring refers to the monitoring of applicants taking online tests in many web browsers. It ensures that users cannot use unauthorized tools or switch between browsers, hence providing a secure environment for tests.

Why is Multi-Browser Monitoring Important?
In the current scenario of remote learning and testing, exam integrity is the need of the hour. Candidates are kept engaged on the test and cheating is prevented by multi-browser monitoring.

Introduction to Think Proctor:-
With the Think Proctor cutting-edge proctoring technology, it hopes to completely overhaul the online testing process. In essence, multi-browser exam monitoring would ensure institutions keep their tests across various platforms but not compromise the user experience of test takers. In total, the idea is simple usability for the examinee and test administrator and harnesses the capability of artificial intelligence and human inspection to achieve total academic integrity.

The candidate’s every single action is being tracked, recorded, and judged in real-time when Think Proctor is implemented so that the administrations of the test can be quite confident with organisations. This is particularly well at preserving the exam credibility even with large-scale and decentralised testing contexts.

Think Proctor Features:-
1. Real Time Browser Switch Alerts:
One of Think Proctor’s best features is its real time tracking of all browser activity going on by it. The system promptly notifies the proctor dashboard if a candidate tries to open new tabs or change browsers. It also blocks websites a candidate tries to open. In order to keep the playing field level throughout assessments, this functionality is essential.

2. Adaptable Monitoring Configurations:
Think Proctor is aware that each institution has different needs. Because of its extremely configurable monitoring settings, managers can establish particular guidelines. For instance, you can ban clipboard activity, limit access to particular URLs, or even manage screen-sharing features. This ensures the monitoring system complies completely with the academic standards in your organization.

3. Compatible with Most Popular Browsers:
Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari are among the numerous other browsers Think Proctor supports in order to get maximum accessibility. This flexibility ensures that test-takers can safely use their preferred devices without encountering any compatibility issues.

Step 1: Create an account and log in:-
Think Proctor ensures administrators have a smooth onboarding process:
