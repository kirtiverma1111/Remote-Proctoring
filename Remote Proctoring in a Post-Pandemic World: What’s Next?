Remote Proctoring in a Post-Pandemic World What’s Next?
Introduction
The global transition of educational institutions’ activity online, including the assessment process, has drastically changed the way colleges, companies and certification bodies conducted examinations during the pandemic. With traditional face-to-face invigilation becoming less productive, remote proctoring services have become the editing pillar of online assessments, masking the geographical boundaries of the candidates taking tests. But as we are adjusting into a post-pandemic such circumstances, what is the future of remote proctoring software?

The Rise of Remote Proctoring Software:
The adoption of new reforms in most education establishments is the step which advances the needs for proctoring solutions. To continue with the practice of online exams, proctoring services turned out to be the natural course of action with diverse ranges of online proctoring tools available for different requirements. Such proctoring services not only make the examination process easier but also makes the stakeholders have some confidence.

Elements That Distinguish Contemporary Remote Proctoring Solutions
Artificial Intelligence Proctoring: The inclusion of Artificial Intelligence in proctoring software has made it easier to manage examinations. In AI proctoring, complex maths problems are designed to spot any illegal acts committed by the candidates throughout the examination.
Services for Off-Site Proctoring: To address the growing need for the provision of examination services, remote proctoring services come in handy as they enable the candidates to sit for the examinations in a controlled environment of their choice thus enhancing their comfort and performance. These services are introduced to make the process easier, but come with the necessity of ensuring the security of the examination process.
Conduct and Examination of the Users: Modern Proctoring Software has both conduct and examination of the users however the purpose differs. In recorded monitoring, the examination administrator can watch the recorded sessions for any irregular performances after the exam has been conducted while in live monitoring, users are constantly overseen with users and the computer networks during examinations that involve high stakes
Artificial Intelligence Proctoring: This can be particularly effective in preventing impersonation attacks where identity verification is a problem. Currently, it is hard to let candidates go through the entire examination in the standard proctored scope. CCTV cameras are not utilised in AI proctoring systems as this circumvents the need for the physical presence of a human invigilator.
The Future Perspectives on Remote Proctoring: …and the potentiality for more changes in the dynamics of remote proctoring cannot be ruled out. As facilitators of remote assessment, the features will be more sophisticated, involving biometric verification among other elements. Such progressive technologies will, to a greater extent, be utilised by educational as well as non-educational institutions to uphold the validity of their evaluations.
Think Proctor – A Novel Solution to Security Issues of Remote Examination: Out of many innovations that have presented themselves in the domain of remote proctoring, Think Proctor, developed by Think Exam along the lines of internet-based proctoring solutions, is probably the most glaring example designed to meet the needs of educational institutions, governments and private companies alike. All of them are aimed at ensuring security of online tests in a step-by-step manner, without compromising the administrators and candidates experiences.
Key Features of Think Remote Proctoring Software:
AI-Based Image Proctoring: The application of advanced facial recognition technology allows Think Proctor to confirm the identity of the candidates, while also immediately identifying if there were any attempts to impersonate another individual, thus allowing only the legitimate candidates to proceed.
AI-Based ID Verification: The feature provides coverage in AI detection and screening of candidates before and during the conduct of the examination, with great effect on reducing the risk for impersonation or fraudulent behaviour.
Recorded Monitoring: A proper surveillance on the whole exam can be harnessed for re-examination of the video feed in deciding whether an action deserves suspicion. This would be way more sensible for tests that are not live video monitored.
Live Monitoring: In cases requiring predominant live monitoring, i.e., those examinations requiring the administrators to keep an eye on the process live, Think Proctor does offer live monitoring. It allows human proctors to monitor the examination right as it happens and take prompt action if any acts of misconduct are noticed. 
ThinkExam Remote Proctoring is designed to enable institutions and corporations to smoothly shift from traditional in-person examinations to online assessments without compromising quality and integrity. The ease of use in the platform, together with its tools powered by artificial intelligence, provides an opportunity for candidates to take their exams in a secure and unobtrusive manner, allowing them to concentrate on their performance while examination conditions are strictly in place.

Conclusion

As the world learns to survive beyond the pandemic grips, there is some bright foolproof proof that remote proctoring is here to stay. Advanced state-of-the-art software for remote proctoring, such as Think Proctor, will make possible the examination process that is free and fair both in institutional and corporate spheres.
