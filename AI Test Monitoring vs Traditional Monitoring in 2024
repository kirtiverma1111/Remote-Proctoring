Think Proctor: A Cutting-Edge Remote Proctoring Solution
As far as advancements in the sphere of remote proctoring are concerned, Think Proctor by Think Exam could easily pass as one that addresses the increasing demand of educational institutions, government agencies, and even corporate bodies worldwide. Think Proctor comprises full-fledged Remote Proctoring Software that arranges nearly all possible resources in protecting online examination processes without compromising any operational efficiency of both the customers and the examinants.

Key Features of Think Remote Proctoring
AI-based Image Proctoring: The advanced technology of identifying faces helps ensure that every exam-taking candidate takes their proper place. In case of attempts to impersonate the candidate, real-time monitoring helps to allow only the real and duly authorised candidate take the test.
AI-based ID Verification: The information is geared explicitly for the candidates before the examination and non-operational during the examination. This second shield alleviates damage at the cost of discrimination or other wrongful behaviours towards soliciting the services of a surrogate.
Recorded Monitoring: Encompasses the records of the entire exam and the individual processes. Supervisors or managers may later assess the tape for any unusual actions, making it appropriate for tests where real-time supervision is impractical.
Live Monitoring: Typically, the above prohibitions on cheating apply to exams that the student takes under the supervision of a proctor, without any restriction or time limit. In the case of Think Proctor, a live proctor is able to monitor and manage the exam process, allowing for immediate intervention should there be any case of cheating.
